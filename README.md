# Project Scope
Main aim of our application is to serve patients with online medical facilities like online appointment, online doctor consultation, online patient track record, online doctor rating and optional feature of medicines’ home delivery.
The patients who can’t travel to doctor can directly consult with them through online doctor consultation feature provided in our application.
Patients can check the ratings of doctors and select the best doctor for themselves.
Some patient can’t invest a lot of time waiting in a long queue in doctors’ clinic can use our application for online appointment.
In some cases, patients forget to take their previous reports, x-rays, ECG, sonography so to overcome this problem our application serves with online patient track record which will store the x-rays, ECG, sonography reports form the day the user will start using our application.
Some patients who want to investigate the ingredients of the medicine and the proportion of the ingredient used can surf our application.
Patients who are capable of walking properly and don’t want home delivery can use our offline medicines option in which we will provide the nearest shop address and their number.
After a patient has consulted the doctor, the doctor will send the prescription to the patient online, and the user will have to decide that he wants online medicines or offline
medicines.
