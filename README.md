Usually people face certain problem in finding a skilled doctor in their nearby area.
Nowadays people are having a hectic life, due to this sometimes they are unaware of their
nearby area. Thus its quite difficult to find a skilled doctor and to maintain different
medical reports. Therefore there is a need of a application which will resolve this
problem. Team EUPHORIA comes with the solution. Team EUPHORIAâ€™s aim is to
provide a skilled doctor to its each and every user. With the help of EUPHORIA
HEALTH CARE one can maintain their all report using QR code. QR code will be
generated for each patient and it will contain the past report of the patient this will make
easy for doctor to diagnose one disease and for patient maintaining their medical history.
EUPHORIA HEALTH CARE is connected to the nearby medical store too. This will
make one to get prescribed medicine easily. Other then Doctor and Patient, there are two
modules of the application which are Pharmacist and Medical Representative. Medical
representative make sure that ever area have a medical store and if any area does not any
medical store then he/she submit a report to the EUPHORIA HEALTH CARE. He will
also make a survey in area and gather the information about the disease spreading
