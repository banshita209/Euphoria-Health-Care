					<td>The steps to take when a cardiac arrest is suspected are:
					<p>Command someone to call 911 or the medical alert system for the locale.</p>
					<p>Immediately start chest compressions regardless of your training.</p>
					<p> Compress hard and fast in the center of the chest, allowing recoil between compressions.</p>
					<p> Hand this task over to those who are trained if and when they arrive.</p>
					<p>If you are trained, use chest compressions and rescue breathing.</p>
					<p> An AED should be applied and used. But it is essential not to delay chest compressions, so finding one should be commanded to someone else while you are doing chest compressions.</td>

					<td><p><b><h1>First Aid for Bleeding :</h1></b></p><br><img src="images/bleeding.jpg"  width="400" height="300"><br><br><br></td>
					<td>There are steps to take if you are faced with bleeding right now.
					<p>Cover the wound with a gauze or a cloth and apply direct pressure to stop the blood flow. Don't remove the cloth. Add more layers if needed.</p>
					<p> The cloth will help clots form to stop the flow.</p>
					<p>In most cases, applying a tourniquet may do more damage to the limb than good. </p>
					<p>The 2010 American Heart Association guidelines also discount the value of elevation and using pressure points.</p></td>

					<td>Take these first aid steps:
					<p>Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes.</p>
					<p> Do not use ice.</p>
					<p>Apply a light gauze bandage.</p>
					<p>Do not apply ointments, butter, or oily remedies to the burn.</p>
					<p>Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief if necessary.</p>

					<td><p><b><h1>First Aid for Blisters :</h1></b></p><br><img src="images/blisters.jpg"  width="400" height="300"><br><br><br></td>
					<td><p>Whether or not a blister needs any treatment is debatable. </p>
					<p>If the blister is small, unbroken and not very painful, it is probably best to leave it alone. Cover it to prevent continued rubbing and pressure on it that can cause it to swell more and possibly burst on its own.</p>
					<p>If the blister is large or painful especially if the activity is not finished (such as you are in the middle of a hike) follow steps to drain and dress a blister. </p>
					<p>Use a sterilized needle and make small punctures at the edge of the blister and express the fluid. Then apply antibiotic ointment and cover it to protect it from further rubbing and pressure.</p></td>

					<p>Don't try to straighten it.</p>
					<p>Stabilize the limb using a splint and padding to keep it immobile.</p>
					<p>Put a cold pack on the injury, avoiding placing ice directly on the skin.</p>
					<p>Elevate the extremity.</p>
					<p>Give anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or naproxen.</p></td>

					<td><p><b><h1>First Aid for Sprains :</h1></b></p><br><img src="images/sprains.jpg"  width="400" height="300"><br><br><br></td>
					<td><p>The symptoms of a sprain are almost exactly the same as that of a broken bone.</p>
					<p> When in doubt, first aid for sprains should be the same as broken bones.</p>
					<p>Immobilize the limb, apply a cold pack, elevate it, and take anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
					<p> See your doctor for further diagnosis and treatment. </p></td>

					<td><p><b><h1>First Aid for Nosebleeds :</h1></b></p><br><img src="images/nosebleeds.jpg"  width="400" height="300"><br><br><br></td>
					<td><p>The first aid for nosebleed includes:</p>
					<p>Lean forward, not back.</p>
					<p>Pinch the nose just below the bridge. Don't pinch the nostrils closed by pinching lower.</p>
					<p>Check after five minutes to see if bleeding has stopped. If not, continue pinching and check after another 10 minutes.</p>
					<p>You can also apply a cold pack to the bridge of the nose while pinching.</p></td>

					<td><p><b><h1>First Aid for Frostbite:</h1></b></p><br><img src="images/frostbite.jpg"  width="400" height="300"><br><br><br></td>
					<td><p>Treating frostbite is a delicate procedure of gradual warming. If at all possible, this should be done by professionals at a medical facility.</p>
					<p> First, get out of the cold. Small areas of minor frostbite may be rewarmed by skin-to-skin contact, but avoid using any heat sources or hot packs.</p>
					<p>If you can't make it to a medical facility, use immersion of the affected area in warm water (98 to 105 F) for 20 to 30 minutes to rewarm it. </p>
					<p>Do not rub the affected area or use heat sources</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><p><b><h1>First Aid for Bee Stings :</h1></b></p><br><img src="images/beestings.jpg"  width="400" height="300"><br><br><br></td>
					<td><p>Use these bee sting first aid tips:</p>
					<p>Get the stinger out any way you can to prevent more venom being delivered. It's a myth that any particular way is better or worse.</p>
					<p>If the person is known to be allergic to bee stings, use an EpiPen to prevent anaphylaxis or call 911 if none is available.</p>
					<p>Use a cold pack to reduce swelling at the site, but take care not to cause frostbite. </p>
					<p>Use an antihistamine like Benadryl (diphenhydramine) to reduce swelling and itching. </p>
					<p>Try ibuprofen or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain.</p>
					<p>Monitor the person who was stung by signs of anaphylaxis, including hives, redness or itching in other areas of the body, and shortness of breath.</p>

					<td><p><b><h1>First Aid for Jellyfish Stings :</h1></b></p><br><img src="images/jellyfishstings.jpg"  width="400" height="300"><br><br><br></td>
					<td><p>Takes these first aid steps for jellyfish stings.</p>
					<p>Rinse the area of the sting generously with vinegar for at least 30 seconds.</p>
					<p>If you don't have vinegar available, use a baking soda slurry instead.</sp>
					<p>Immerse the affected area in hot water, as hot as the person can tolerate, for at least 20 minutes or until the pain goes away. If hot water isn't available, use dry hot packs. If those aren't available, use dry cold packs. Other methods to relieve pain are less effective (such as urine, fresh water wash, papain or meat tenderizer).</p>
					<p>Do not use a pressure bandage.</p>
